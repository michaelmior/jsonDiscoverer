<p>Utilities for the JSON discoverer.</p>

<p>In particular, we have implemented</p>
<ul>
<li>A path solver based in the Dijkstra algorithm to calculate the shortest path between two elements 
(see <code>DijkstraSolver</code>). 
The algorithm has been especially adapted to search path in EMF models</li>
<li>A converter from EMF to GEXF graph format (see <code>GexfConverter</code>). This utility is used to generate graph representations 
out of EMF models. In the context of the JSON discoverer, it is used to represent JSON-based Web APIs
as graphs and therefore facilitate the visualiation of APIs compositions</li>
<li>A model helper to facilitate the management of EMF models (e.g., loading/saving models/metamodels) 
(see <code>ModelHelper</code>)</li>
</ul>
